# Barone Italian Citizenship

## Overview
Italian Citizenship is based on a simple pass from parent to child.  Thi means that an Italian Citizen can pass citizenship onto children regardless of:
- Where the parent is born
- Where the child is born
- If either ever lived in Italy.
- If the child's birth was registered in Italy

Because of this, a relative with Italian Citizenship can pass it down the line to any children, indefinitely.

## What Does Citizenship Mean
Going through this process will result in the Italian Government recognizing you as an Italian Citizen.  More specifically, you will be a Dual United States / Italian Citizen. 

This means:
- You can freely live in Italy.
- You can freely work in Italy.
- You can apply for a European Union Passport, allowing you to freely travel between all EU Territories.

You can also pass your citizenship on to any children you might have, giving them the same freedoms from above.

You can also pass on you citizenship to your spouse, but there are a few more hurdles for them.  Most notably, they must learn to speak Italian and pass an Italian Fluency test.




## The Process
To inherit citizenship, one must 
- Find a relative that:
    - Was an Italian citizen
    - Was able to pass citizenship to their children, but didn't. 
- Prove that:
    - Your relative was in fact an Italian citizen when they had children   
    - Anyone between said relative and oneself are direct descendants
    - Oneself is a child of your parent


### Finding a Relative 
After YEARS of research, this is now done!  Meet, Guiseppe (Joe) Barone!

- Guiseppe was born in 1881 in Modica Italy, making him an Italian Citizen.  
- His parents were both Italian Citizens, so there is no question he was one also.
- He had 4 children, John, Sam, Rosario, and George.  The latest of which was born in 1916.


To assure that Joe could pass his citizenship on to his children, we needed to verify that he did not denounce his Italian Citizenship (Nationalize - Becoming a US Citizen) prior to having his children.  This information is hard to be sure of, as public records of nationalization are not readily available.  This is especially difficult with Joe, as he came to the US in the early 1900's, then went back to Italy, and finally came back to the US.  During any of these moves, he could have denounced either citizenship, and muddied the water on his eligibility.

Ultimatley, to know for sure, our only option was to hire a researcher at the National Archives and Records Association to find all the paperwork they had on Joe (this paperwork is called an 'A-File' or 'Alien File').  That process took over a year!  But, we can now be absolutely certain that Joe didn't nationalize until 1951, long after having his son Sam.

This, and many other documents are now part of the public record, and we have a stack of physical copies.

### Proving Relation
We have a relative, but now we need to prove to Italian Government that we are related. To do this, we need to have Birth, Marriage, and Death Certificates for all relatives between.  In my case (Travis Zimmerman) for example, I need Sam Barone, Carole Zimmerman, Barrett Zimmerman, and My Birth, Marriage, and Death (where applicable) Certificates.

All of these documents need to be:
- Official, as in, received from the archives. Not a copy.
- Have an accompanying Apostille.
- Translated into Italian by a professional translator.
